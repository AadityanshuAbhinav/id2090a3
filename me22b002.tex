Albert Einstein’s (Figure~\ref{pic}) paper “Does the Inertia of a Body Depend Upon Its Energy Content?” was published in the journal “Annalen der Physik” on November 21, 1905.

The paper revealed the relationship between energy and mass that would eventually lead to the famous mass-energy equivalence formula 

\begin{equation}
    E = mc^2
    \label{main_eqn}
\end{equation}

where E is the body's kinetic energy, m is the increased relativistic mass of the body and c is the speed of light.
