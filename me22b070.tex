Length contraction\footnote{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Length\_contraction}
is the phenomenon that a moving object's length is measured to be shorter than its proper length, which is 
the length as measured in the object's own rest frame.Length contraction was postulated by George FitzGerald
and Hendrik Antoon Lorentz. Einstein showd that length contraction could be explained using special 
relativity, which changed the notions of space, time, and simultaneity.

\begin{equation}
	L=L_0(1-v^2/u^2)^\frac{1}{2}
\end{equation}

where 
\begin{itemize}
	\item L is the length observed by an observer in motion relative to the object
	\item $L_0$ is the proper length (the length of the object in its rest frame)
\end{itemize}
